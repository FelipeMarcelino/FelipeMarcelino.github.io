## From Senior to Lead Data Scientist and ML Engineer

- Lead need to be confident to work in any team
- Avoid lack of consistency: systematically repeating old mistakes can be a sign that senior behavior
is not yet internalized
- Diminishing returns will hit when the senior data scientist become to accommodate to the task
- Traits to be copied or enforced by the team from senior ds is a good signal for lead level
- Become point of contact from other specialists
- It is necessary to have a promotion case worked together with the manager and of course
opportunities to influence others
- Focusing to change the nature of the work instead to adding more responsibilities
- Lead operates in team level
- Lead need to focus on high leverage tasks, for example: strategic planning, mentoring other ds,
settings critical goals, align with stakeholders.
- Is time to build tools/libraries to be used by the squad that are bottlenecks. Should be a code that
is often repeated on notebook and be transformed into something reusable
- Sharing knowledge explain how to use a open source library, explain a new approach, create new ways
to solve things
- Interact with other person helping them to clarifying a task. Support other ds
  - Take care to not become overwhelmed by all the help requests
- Helps team to navigate between the trade-off of the choices
- Help other people coaching them, helping juniors to become seniors
- Archetypes:
  - tech lead: help others to make usual steps good and jump between special topics
  - solver: taking things from scratch, jump between big issues, create first versions
  - architect: specialized in scalable impact in terms of infrastructure. Set standards and recommended the right
    approach
  - right hand: involved in technical knowledge with business and organizational problems.

## Python

- Strategy is a design pattern used to control different algorithms depending on the context
- Strategy is possible to implement with functions when there is no states/variables necessary on
the classes
- Using functions is not necessary to instantiate new objects for each algorithm strategy
- We can use `decorators` to register each one of the strategy
- We can use `Callable` to type function using on strategy design pattern

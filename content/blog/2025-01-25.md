## Gtd and taskwarrior

Today I read about GTD (Get Things Done) and task warrior. I have some
understandings about the idea to how to organize the tasks. However, I have some
questions related to GTD:

- Which situation the actions that received `+waiting` will appears to be
  executed?
- About defer, I have some questions related to actions that is from a project
  but does not receive `+next` tag. When this task will be reviewed?
- When I have to use `tickle` instead of `think`? Or `tickle` is only to support
  `think` command?

To answer the questions above:

- Some items are delegate (postpone) with `due` and `waiting` specific dates,
  but it is not related to `tickle` or `think` because both use `in` tag
- `think` when you want to think about something one more day, need to be a
  yes/no question.
- `tickle` is about tasks that you do not want think right now about it, and not
  be displayed until certain date
- Both `think` and `tickle` are different from _delegate_ because they do not
  put a task inside **inbox**. Delegate are related to **actionable** tasks as
  well, not abstract ones.

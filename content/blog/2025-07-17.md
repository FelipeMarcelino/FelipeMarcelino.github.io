## English

Cleft sentences and inversion let me **spotlight exactly what matters** without over‑using adverbs like *really* or *very*.
One well‑placed emphasis structure per paragraph / slide = reader instantly knows the key point.

### 1 Cleft‑Sentence Templates

| Pattern | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **It‑cleft**<br>*It + was/were + **focus** + that/who + rest* | Pulls the focus word to the front | *It was **latency** that we optimised.* |
| **What‑cleft**<br>*What + clause + be‑verb + **focus*** | Saves focus for the end | *What we need is **clean data**.* |

**Tip:** drop **that** only in informal speech: *“It was cost we cut.”*

### 2 Negative / Adverbial Inversion

| Trigger | Form | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Never / Not only / Rarely / Hardly / Little | **Trigger + aux + subject + verb + …** | *Never **have we shipped** so fast.*<br>*Not only **did** the model converge, **but** it also generalised.* |

> Works like question order → dramatic, formal.

### 3 Decision Flow

1. **Need emphasis?**
   - Highlight one noun → **It‑cleft**.
   - Highlight whole idea/result → **What‑cleft**.
   - Highlight rarity/extreme → **Inversion**.
2. **Check context** (slides, formal report, chat).
3. **Use ONE emphasis device** per chunk to avoid melodrama.

### 4 My Live Examples

- *It was **recall** that convinced the stakeholders.*
- *What the pipeline lacks is **robust logging**.*
- *Never have I seen such **low latency** on CPU.*
- *Rarely does a silver‑bullet fix move the needle.*

### 5 Common Pitfalls

| Faulty | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| *It was latency we optimised **not** throughput.* | Add comma: *It was latency that we optimised, **not** throughput.* |
| *Hardly we saw any gain.* | **Hardly did we see** any gain. |
| Overuse (every slide starts “It was…”) | Limit to most important takeaway. |

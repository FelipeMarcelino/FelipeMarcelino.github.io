## English - Reported Speech

- I have finished work (Direct Speech) - He said he had finished (Reported Speech)

- I will go (Direct Speech ) - He said he would go (Reported Speech)
- i can speak English (Direct Speech) - She said she could speak English (Reported Speech)

> [!tip] Tense Shift (Backshifting)
> When reporting, we usually shift the tense one step int o the past if the reporting verb is in the past
> We **don't always backshift** when the reporting verb is present tense or if the info is still true

### Reporting Questions
- Do you speak English? (Direct) - He asked if I spoke English
  - Use: `asked if/whether` + statement word order (no inversion)
- Wh-questions(where, what, why, how)
  - Where do you live? (Direct) - She asked where I lived

## Python - Function as objects

- It is possible to assign function to variables
- `__doc__` to see function documentation
- High order functions are functions that receive functions as arguments
  - `map` and `sorted` are functions that receives other functions
  - `sorted(fruits, key=len)`
- `map` and `filter` can be replaced by list comprehension and generation
- Anonymous functions are used with `lambda` and the best usage is with high order functions
  - `sorted (fruits, key=lambda word: word[::-1])`
- `callable` are used to detect callable objects
  - `__call__` can be implemented for classes
- `functools.partial` are used to implement partial functions
  - Partial functions use some arguments with object and use others to execute

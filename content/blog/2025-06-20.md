## English - Advanced Puctuation for Clear, Persuasive writing

- **Semicolon (;)** - links two closely related independent clauses without a conjunction - Model A converged
quickly; Model B overffited
- **Colon (:)** - Introduces a list, explanation, or quote after complete clause - Only one metric
  mattered: recall
- **Em-dash (-)** - Dramatic break, extra info, or parenthetical stronger than commas - Latency dropped
  \- 40% in fact - after pruning
- **Parentheses (())** - Side notes, acronyms, citations - We used adaptive optimisers (AdamW)

### Examples:
- Semicolon: We ran five epochs; the loss plateaued
- Colon: Remember three rules: validate, version, verify
- Em-dash: Cost- though higher than expected- was justified
- Parentheses: The pipeline uses an ETL stage (extract-transform-load) before training

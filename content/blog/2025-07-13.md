## ðŸ“Œ Why this note?
Standard 1st/2nd/3rd conditionals give the *timeline*; **modals** layered on top add *certainty, ability, advice, criticism*.
Mastery = one sentence that shows *when* + *how likely/obligatory*.

## ðŸ”‘ Core grid

| Base form | Result-clause + modal | Typical nuance | Example |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|---------|
| **1st**<br>If + present | **will / may / might / can** + V | future fact / possibility | *If it rains, we **may** cancel.* |
| **2nd**<br>If + past | **would / could / might** + V | unreal present | *If I had 64 GB RAM, I **could** fine-tune GPT-2 locally.* |
| **3rd**<br>If + had PP | **would / could / might / should + have PP** | unreal past result | *If weâ€™d cached data, latency **could have** dropped.* |
| **Mixed** | If + had PP â‡’ **would be / would V** now | past condition â†’ present effect | *If sheâ€™d joined, we **would be** faster today.* |

> **Modal shades**
> *could* = unreal ability / possibility   *might* = weak probability
> *should* = advice / criticism   *must* = logical certainty / policy

## ðŸŽ¯ Fast patterns to paste

- **If + past perfect, should have PP** â†’ polite blame
  > *If you had logged the seed, we **should have** reproduced the bug.*

- **If + present, might V** â†’ cautious forecast
  > *If load spikes tonight, latency **might** rise.*

- **If + past, could V** â†’ hypothetical ability
  > *If I spoke Spanish, I **could** join the LatAm call.*

## ðŸ›  Pitfalls / Fixes

| Faulty | Why | Fix |
|--------|-----|-----|
| *If weâ€™d optimized, accuracy **would improve**.* | Past â‡’ present mismatch | **would have improved** (3rd) |
| *If tests fail, latency **would spike**.* | Too strong for 1st | **might / could spike** |

## ðŸ’¬ Chunk bank (reuse)

- *If thatâ€™s the case, we **may need** toâ€¦*
- *Had we known, we **would have** shipped earlier.* (inverted 3rd)
- *If resources allow, we **could** run a larger grid-search.*

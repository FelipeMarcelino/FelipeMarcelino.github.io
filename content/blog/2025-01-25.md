## Gtd and taskwarrior

Today I read about GTD (Get Things Done) and task warrior. I have some
understandings about the idea to how to organize the tasks. However, I have some
questions related to GTD:

- Which situation the actions that received `+waiting` will appears to be
  executed?
- About defer, I have some questions related to actions that is from a project
  but does not receive `+next` tag. When this task will be reviewed?
- When I have to use `tickle` instead of `think`? Or `tickle` is only to support
  `think` command?

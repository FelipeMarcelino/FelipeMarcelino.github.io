- Today I implemented again the GTD on Taskwarrior using tags and context
- `+in` for inbox and `+next` for next actions to executed
- For actions delegated we can use `+waiting` + `pro:Project` and use the modifier `wait:date`
- For defered task we can use the `scheduled:date` label
- Multi-steps project can use `depends:taskid,taskid` to create dependency between tasks
- Someday/maybe can be postpone using `+maybe` tag

## All the ideas going to inbox (GTD)?

Yes, every task, idea, commitments starts in your inbox. It prevents usage of mental energy, ensures
not is lost in the middle of the path, and decouples captures from the processing.

> [!tip]
> Inbox need to be review every day, so inbox need to cleared every day

## Reference in GTD

Use external tool to store references and annotate it on Taskwarrior. Maybe we can use Zotero or
other tools.

## Recurring tasks on Taskwarrior

Examples:

```bash
# Daily review at 9 AM
> task add "Daily Planning" due:today recur:daily

# Weekly team meeting (every Monday)
> task add "Team Sync" due:2025-06-09 recur:weekly

# Quarterly tax payment (every 3 months)
> task add "Pay estimated taxes" recur:3months
```

Show all the recurring tasks:
```bash
task recur: list  # Show all recurring tasks
```

## Tags for context

Use `+@` for context tags and only `+` for states/categories

## GTD

- Every project need to have at least one task with `next` tag coupled. All
  projects have tasks waiting to be done.
- There is next action not related to project
- Context serves as a way to filtering tasks to be done in a exact
  moment/situation
  - +phone, +car, +mobile, +work are all tags related to some context where the
    task apply and only in that situation this task can be done
- Filtering can be done with other triggers as well, as to wait specific day to
  appear an specific task. One task need to be done after another X task being
  completed. One task need to be done after a event happening and etc
- `+waiting` need to be revisited weekly/monthly

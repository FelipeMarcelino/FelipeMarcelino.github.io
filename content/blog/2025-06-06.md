- Today I use some commands to list tasks that repeat on my schedules like `Write things to Zettelkasten`
  - the correct way to show is `task recur list`
    - It shows my task related to review someday/maybe list as well
- read chapter 5 of fluent python book
  - read about `@dataclasses`, `collections.namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple`
    - They are types of fabric class
    - There is a minor difference between `namedtuple` and `typing.NamedTuple` is the second one can
    have typing annotations. However, both inherent from tuple
  - `@dataclass` has the special method `__post_init__` to deal with post initialization

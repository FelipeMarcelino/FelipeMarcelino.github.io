## English - Paragraph-Level Cohesion

- **Pronoun / demostrative reference** - Replace a noun with *he*, *she*, *it*, *they*, *this*, *these*
so you don't repeat it - The neural network was huge. **It** had 12 B parameters
- **Lexical chahins** - Repeat key words or use synonyms to keep the topic alive - Model A, the system
this architecture
- **Substitution** - Swap a chin with *one / ones / do / so* to avoid repetition - Take the blue pill
or the red one
- **Ellipsis** - Omit a word/phrase that's obvious from context - I'll write the intro; you [ will
 write ] the conclusion
- **Paragraph Transitions** - A bridge sentence that looks back and points forward - "While cost
matters, accuracy is crucial. The next section compares the two models."

Paragraph unity is built with (1) pronoun reference, (2) lexical chains, (3) substitution/ellipsis,
(4) bridge sentences. Example:

Machine A uses less RAM. **As a result, it** trains faster and **therefore** costs less.

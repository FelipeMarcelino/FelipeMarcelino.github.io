## Fluent Python - References, mutability and memory

- Variables are not boxes but tags
- An object can have multiple variables assigned to it, and it disappears when every variable is not
 assigned to it anymore.
- `is` is to compare object `id` while `==` is compare object values
  - Except when we have a singleton, so in that way make sense compare objects using `is` like we use
  using `None` comparison.
- `is` is faster than `==`
- `==` is suggar for `__eq__` special method
- Shallow and Deep are ways to copy and reference objects in python
- Function parameters is *call by sharing*
  - Mutable variables are changed while immutable remain the same
  - Does not change the object identity

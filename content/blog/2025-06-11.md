## Python
- Type hints in functions are used to help static analyses tools like `mypy` to identify types
- Type hints are optional and do not improve performance
- Use one space after `:` and one between the two sides on `=`
- `Optional` is used with `None` or when the parameter accepts `None` value
- `Duck typing` is a typing check for type of operation
- `Nominal typing` is related to the implementation of the code
- `Union` is like `or` and `|` can used in as **replace**
  - Avoid to use `Union` in the return of the function because we have to test the value returned
- Use `list` to type returns and `Sequence` or `Iterable` to type parameters
- `TypeVar` is generic types
  - Can be restrictive: `NumberT = TypeVar('NumberT', float, Decimal, Fraction)`
  - Can be delimited:`HashableT = TypeVar('HashableT', bound=Hashable)`
- `Protocols` is related to the implementation
